            Jordan has traveled the world as both a player and trainer – he has
            worked with some of the NBAs’ top talents including Zach Lavine,
            Klay Thompson, and dozens of others. In doing so he has carefully
            crafted a training philosophy that is simple yet innovative and
            geared to work with athletes of all skill levels. Throughout the
            process of building this training business, Jordan has cultivated a
            culture like no other. The truth is there are no shortcuts. Becoming
            the best possible athlete you can be is not easy. But with the right
            team behind you, the sky is the limit. We embrace the process… We
            create an environment that will help you hit your basketball goals,
            no matter what they might be. If you’re a pro? Great. We’ll refine
            areas of your game that can help you get 1% better every day. If
            you're a youth athlete? We’ll help you make the team, earn a
            starting role, or get a scholarship while building your confidence
            and basketball IQ. If you’re a casual hooper? We’ll help you
            dominate the rec league. At JLawBball INC, our mission is to help
            you reach your full potential. At our state-of-the-art facility in

            mental performance, and online programs. We are constantly honing

            our athletes improve. Come in for a training session and start your
            journey to separate yourself from the rest of your competition.
